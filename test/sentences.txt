The crystal structure of the six-helix bundle core of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains an extended central trimeric coiled coil of N-terminal heptad-repeat sequences and distinctly shorter C-terminal helices that are limited to two central heptad-repeat units within the longer heptad-repeat sequence (see Fig. 1).
The E protein of coronaviruses is largely localized within the secretory pathway  where it has recently been described for IBV to exist in two different pools; one of monomeric E proteins that disrupt the secretory pathway and a second pool in an oligomeric state, likely serving to facilitate the assembly of progeny virions .
The functions of these nonstructural proteins between the S and the E genes in coronaviruses are unknown.
The genome encodes for proteins that are homologous to known coronavirus proteins, such as the replicase proteins (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E).
The multimerization of nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses is possibly a functional form of the protein, which may be involved in the virion assembly by stabilizing the helical structure of the N protein [26].
